      <h2>About This Mission</h2>

      <p>
        This website was founded with a simple calling, to lift high the Word of God and to remind every soul that His truth still speaks today.
        Here, we come together as a family of faith, seeking strength in His promises, peace in His presence, and purpose in sharing His message with the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the world feels heavy, His Word remains a lamp to our feet and a light to our path.
        When our hearts grow weary, Scripture breathes life once more and draws us back to the comfort of His grace.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our mission is to carry that light beyond these pages. To help spread His Word as far and as faithfully as we can,
        so that hearts everywhere may know His love, His mercy, and His truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a place to pause, to listen, and to remember who we are in Christ.
        May every verse you read here stir your spirit, renew your hope, and move you to share the everlasting message of God’s Word with the world.
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:600; margin-top:1em;">
        The Mission is simple. The Calling is clear.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:600; margin-top:1em;">
       Spread HIS Word.
